# Square-law-mod-and-demod

Amplitude Modulation is the process of mixing a low frequency signal with a
high frequency one to increase the transmission efficiency. Square law
modulation technique is done by passing the modified versions of these carrier
and message signal into a non-linear device such as diode to receive the
squared output. Filtering is done to extract the necessary terms representing
amplitude modulation. Amplitude Demodulation is the reverse process of this.
In this project we have done a mathematical study on these techniques and
experimented the concepts using MATLAB.
